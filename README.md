# CS50-Final-Project

This is my Final Project submission for the CS50x Course.

## What does it do?
The idea is simple: to calculate the electronic configuration of any element given its atomic number and output it on the screen.

## How does it accomplish it?
The main function is housed inside the `elec_config.py` Python file, which imports data about all 118 existing elements from `elec_config_data.py`. The main function is `electronicConfiguration(n)`, which requires one parameter `n`, which is an integer that contains the atomic number of the required element. The calculation takes place using subshells, orbital notations and the total number of elements in each shell and orbital.
There also two helper functions, `iupacName(n)` and `elemSearch(n)`, both of which make use of the atomic number of the required element. `elemSearch(n)` searches the dictionary of lists, `elements`, which was imported from `elec_config_data.py`, for the name and symbol of the given atomic number among the existing 118 elements. If it does not exist in `elements`, a name and symbol for the given atomic number is generated by the `iupacName(n)` function, using the conventions laid out by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).
The functions `electronicConfiguration(n)`, `elemSearch(n)` and `iupacName(n)` are called inside `app.py` to find the electronic configuration of the atomic number input by the user using a form in `index.html`. The generated output is returned to the user through `index.html` using a POST request via Flask.
